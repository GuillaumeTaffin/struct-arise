# struct-arise

**Create and evolve software systems at AI speed!**

Structured specifications for the AI-assisted engineering era. struct-arise turns your requirements, architecture, and design decisions into structured data that both humans and machines can reason about, enabling deterministic spec-code traceability, scoped context for AI agents, and continuous validation that your code matches your intent.

## Why

AI tools write code faster than ever, but speed without direction is waste. The new bottleneck is keeping the full picture (vision, specs, architecture, code) coherent as things evolve. struct-arise makes that possible by treating specifications as structured, queryable, machine-readable artifacts rather than prose that drifts away from reality.

## What

- An opinionated framework for creating and storing structured specs
- A server with multiple interfaces (CLI, MCP for AI agents, potential web UI)
- A methodology where engineers drive design through structured specs, then delegate implementation with clear, traceable requirements
